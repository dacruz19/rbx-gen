# rbx-gen

Works on online python so you can just run it there

## Very Important
Not Every Code will actually work even if the format is correct and may take ages before you actually get a working code. Also not exactly sure about whether the format is correct, the "RI-" at the start of each code was from a friend's guess after looking at some gifcards so if it doesn't work feel free to change the code
